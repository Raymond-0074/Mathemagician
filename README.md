# Becoming a Mathemagician

This book/set of notes is dedicated to my TT6 and TT8 classes as they embark on their academic endeavours of preparing for their selective school exams.

I hope that this set of notes will serve them well in the lead up to the exams and beyond. I must warn in advance that this set of notes is no substitute for a teacher providing details in the subject, nor is it a way to get around practising the questions as that is the only way I know of to properly gain intuition about a subject. Rather, it serves to complement what is learnt in class and act as a bit of a summary and guidebook for when you are unsure.
 
This book is not designed to be read in order, but can be skipped to the section you need the most help with. However, if you are unsure of certain reasonings, be sure to turn back a few pages to try to properly understand concepts before moving on. Where possible, I have attempted to order the sections in a coherent way where later chapters built on the foundations of the earlier chapters.
 
In a typical Mr Raymond fashion, I remind you to use a pencil for maths, just as my former teacher, who was 50-times older than me, flamboyantly told my year 8 class to use one.
