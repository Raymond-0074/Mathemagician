    "## Part I: Order of operations (BEDMAS)\n",
    "Perhaps of upmost importance in maths is following the order of operations. There is no inherent law of universe saying that we need to follow this convention (i.e. the universe will not end if we follow SAMDEB instead), it is just a way that all mathematicians agree upon so that they can understand each other's working out. It is entirely possible that in an alternate universe that we followed SAMDEB instead and that is perfectly fine."

    "This should be a trivial concept to understand, but should not be overlooked. When applying BEDMAS we first look for the innermost bracket and deal with any exponentials within it. Then we deal with any division or multiplication from left to right as they occur. And finally we deal with any addition or subtraction, once again from left to right as they occur. Once the expression within that bracket has been solved, we can move out to the next set of brackets and repeat. Note that a number before a bracket without any operation is implied to be a multiplication. It also does not matter what type of bracket we use, sometimes we use different ones so that it is easier to see where each set of brackets ends.\n",
